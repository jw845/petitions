## Identifying the main themes in UK Parliament e-petitions

The ability to petition Parliament gives the people **power to join together in support of causes and effect change**. In the UK, British citizens and UK residents are able to create petitions on the UK Parliament petitions website; at 10,000 signatures petitions will get a response from the government, at 100,000 signatures petitions will be considered for a debate in Parliament (though it's of course not always successful, take [Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU](https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/241584) for example).

**But what, you ask, are the themes that keep appearing?** In an age of information overload, it can be hard to keep track. In the notebook hosted in this repo I use natural language processing and topic modelling to pull out the key themes in petitions submitted by members of the public to the UK Parliament e-petitions website.

Data is sourced from the [UK Parliament petitions website](https://petition.parliament.uk/), available under the Open Government Licence v3.0 ([OGL v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)). More info on the history of the UK Parliament petitions website can be found in the [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Parliament_petitions_website).
