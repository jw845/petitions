In the UK, British citizens and UK residents are able to create petitions on the UK Parliament petitions website; at 10,000 signatures petitions will get a response from the government, at 100,000 signatures petitions will be considered for a debate in Parliament (though it's of course not always successful, take [Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU](https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/241584) for example).\n",
